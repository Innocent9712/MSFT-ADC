### Questions

- Q: How many Stacks would you need to implement a Queue?
- A: You would need 2 Stacks in order to perform the enqueue and dequeue logic required to make it work as a Queue is expected to.

- Q: Differentiate between a stack and a queue.
- A: A Stack operates on FILO(First In Last Out), meaning that the first item that is put in a Stack is usually the last item to leave the stack. While a Queue operates more linearly as it works with the FIFO(First In First Out) approach. Meaning that the first item put in a Queue is the first item to leave the Queue
